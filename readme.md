## Overview

Chief-of-state (COS) is an Open Source clustered persistence tool for building event sourced applications. COS supports CQRS and
event-sourcing through simple, language-agnostic interfaces via gRPC, and it allows developers to describe their schema
with Protobuf. Under the hood, COS leverages [Akka](https://akka.io/)
to scale out and guarantee performant, reliable persistence.

Chief-of-state was built with the following principles:

* Wire format should be the same as persistence
* Scaling should not require re-architecture
* Developers shouldn't face race conditions or database locks
* Rules should be enforced with interfaces
* Event sourcing is valuable, but challenging to implement
* An ideal event-sourcing datastore would offer random access by key, streaming, and atomic writes

## Anatomy of a chief-of-state app

Developers implement two gRPC interfaces: a write handler for building state and, optionally, many read handlers for
reacting to state changes.

### Chief Of State Service

The main entry point of a chief-of-state based application is the
[Service](https://github.com/chief-of-state/chief-of-state-protos/blob/main/chief_of_state/v1/service.proto). Developers will
interact with chief of state via:

- `ProcessCommand` is used by the application to send commands to process via [Write Handler](#write-handler).
- `GetState` is used by the application to retrieve the current state of a persistent entity

### Write Handler

Developers describe state mutations by implementing two RPCâ€™s in
the [WriteSideHandlerService](https://github.com/chief-of-state/chief-of-state-protos/blob/main/chief_of_state/v1/writeside.proto):

- `HandleCommand` accepts a command and the prior state of an entity and returns an Event. For example, given a command
  to UpdateUserEmail and a User, this RPC might return UserEmailUpdated.
- `HandleEvent` accepts an event and the prior state of an entity and returns a new state. For example, given a
  UserEmailUpdated event and a User, this RPC would return a new User instance with the email updated.

### Read Handler

In response to state mutations, COS is able to send changes to
many [ReadSideHandlerService](https://github.com/chief-of-state/chief-of-state-protos/blob/main/chief_of_state/v1/readside.proto)
implementations, which may take any action. COS guarantees at-least-once delivery of events and resulting state to each
read side in the order they were persisted.

Some potential read side handlers might:

- Write state changes to a special data store like elastic
- Publish changes to kafka topics
- Send notifications to users in response to specific events
